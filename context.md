Below is a step-by-step overview of the team, roles, and procedures.

1. Team Composition (Primary Team)
• Rashmi, Rahul, and Jaydeep (to be involved when required).

2. Access & Data Handling
• Team members will receive all client data uploaded to the platform for scoring.
• If needed, they will extract or add additional data from Probe (internal data source), following data-access controls.
• Secure access to client folders, Probe (read-only or as required), and IRA scoring.

3. Check eligiblity then Questions & Approvals
• We currently have the scoring methodology ready, but questions are pending final approval from Ankit Sir.
• Once approved, the question set will be uploaded to the platform; the counts below are provisional.

4. Scoring Framework (How We Calculate)
• Company-specific: 30 questions (examples: governance, contracts, KPIs).
• Financial-specific: 7 questions (examples: profitability, cash flows, leverage).
• Sector-specific: 20 questions (industry disclosures / SEBI-relevant).
• Total: 57 questions (may change as needed).
• Scoring per question: Yes = 2, Maybe = 1, No = -1, NA = 0.
• Result: Total score → converted to percentage.
  ◦ >65% → IPO Ready
  ◦ 45–65% → Needs Improvement
  ◦ <45% → Not Ready

5. Workflow / Step-by-Step Process
a. Client data intake, including documents and financials.
b. Notification to Rashmi, Rahul, and Jaydeep that a new IRA assessment has been assigned.
c. Owner completes their assigned section in the sheet (Rashmi, Rahul, Jaydeep).
d. If data gaps exist, the team pulls from Probe or requests missing documents from the client via the standard channel.
e. The team adds concise remarks for each question (evidence/links).
f. Rahul/Jaydeep run the summary sheet → percentage & RAG interpretation auto-calculated.
g. Quality review: Piyush Kumar (designated senior) reviews and signs off on scores and remarks.
h. The final consolidated IRA report is prepared and shared with the client and internal stakeholders.
